# BWORKBOOK

‚ö° The B WORKBOOK is now available on CLEARSY's GitHub (https://github.com/CLEARSY/BWORKBOOK).
After several months of effort, the first version can be consulted and used for training in the use of formal methods and teaching the B method.

üòç Many thanks to the contributors and reviewers, fromm Europe et South America, who have made this possible.

‚úÖ The B WORKBOOK now contains 7 exercises of increasing complexity, providing a step-by-step introduction to the various Atelier B functionalities.
It covers the phases of formal specification, implementation, proof, code generation and compilation of the final executable.
Each exercise is supplied with:
- modeling files,
- proof files that automatically demonstrate these models,
- additional manual source code and associated Makefile, for compilation in Unix environments (Windows WSL, Linux, MacOS).
It also contains instructions for using ProB to animate the models.

üòÖ In a future iteration in 2026, new exercises will be added, covering in particular:
- Event-B modeling,
- Graphical animation of models with VisB,
- Rust code generation,
- Interactive proof, proof tactics and writing proof rules.

üåç In the meantime, if you find errors or have ideas for exercises or technical topics to address, please interact through the mechanisms offered by GitHub (issues, PR).
